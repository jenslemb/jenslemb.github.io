I am a PhD student at the Department of Political Science and Public Management at the University of Southern Denmark. I am currently a visiting PhD researcher at the Data Science Lab at the Hertie School in Berlin. I hold an MSc and a BSc in political science.

My research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, econometrics, and public administration. My PhD dissertation examines job mobility in the public sector, where I leverage machine learning methods to improve our understanding of why employees exit organizations. I am also engaged in projects on discrimination against minority citizens in bureaucratic recruitment and access to public services.

I plan to pursue a career in data science and analytics after I finish my PhD (expected August 2023).

Outside work, I am a passionate bridge player, a mediocre mid-distance runner, and a novice sourdough baker.
