    "text": "I am a PhD student at the Department of Political Science and Public Management at the University of Southern Denmark. I am currently a visiting PhD researcher at the Data Science Lab at the Hertie School in Berlin.\nMy research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, econometrics, and public administration. My PhD dissertation examines job mobility in the public sector, where I leverage machine learning methods to improve our understanding of why employees exit organizations. I am also engaged in projects on discrimination against minority citizens in bureaucratic recruitment and access to public services.\nI plan to pursue a career in data science and analytics after I finish my PhD (expected August 2023).\nOutside work, I am a passionate bridge player (♠️♥️♦️♣️), a mediocre mid-distance runner, and a novice sourdough baker."
